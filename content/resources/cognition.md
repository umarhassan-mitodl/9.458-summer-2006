description: Almost 200 years after James Parkinson (1817) first reported the disease
  that bears his name, our understanding of the cognitive deficits caused by Parkinson's
  disease (PD) is still incomplete. In some patients, cognitive problems are severe;
  approximately 10% to 15% PD patients meet the criteria for dementia (Mayeux et al.,
  1988; Growdon et al., 1990). Even in nondemented patients, however, specific cognitive
  deficits are striking. Approximately 60% of nondemented patients are impaired in
  at least one cognitive domain (Growdon et al., 1990), including cognitive control
  processes, memory, verbal ability, and visuospatial functions. Further, cognitive
  dysfunction may correlate with other clinical variables. For example, late-onset
  patients manifest cognitive deficits earlier than early-onset patients, even when
  additive contributions of disease duration and normal aging are taken into account
  (Locascio et al., 2003; Katzen et al., 1998). The administration of levodopa has
  also been shown to impair cognitive performance in PD (e.g., Cools et al., 2006),
  which may result from the selective over-dosing of neural regions that are relatively
  unaffected in PD.
