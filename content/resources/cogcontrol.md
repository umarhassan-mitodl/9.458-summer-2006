description: 'Early stage idiopathic Parkinson''s disease (PD) is characterized by
  the three classic motor symptoms: rigidity, tremor, and bradykinesia. The core pathological
  hallmark of PD is the progressive loss of dopamine (DA) neurons in the ventrolateral
  tier of the substantia nigra pars compacta which primarily projects to the dorsal
  striatum (Fearnley and Lees, 1991; Kish, Shannak, and Hornykiewicz, 1988). The severely
  DA depleted dorsal striatum sends efferents, via the nigrostriatal pathway, to the
  supplementary motor area and distinct areas of the PFC, namely the dorsolateral
  PFC and ventrolateral PFC (Middleton and Strick, 2000a; Middleton and Strick, 2000b).
  Less severely affected are direct dopaminergic projections from the ventral tegmental
  area (VTA) to the PFC via the mesocortical pathway (Uhl, Hedreen, and Price, 1985).
  Due to the strong reciprocal connections between the striatum and specific areas
  of the frontal cortex, PD pathology results in a host of executive deficits, such
  as planning, attentional set-shifting, and working memory. These cognitive deficits
  are similar, but not identical, to ones observed with frontal lobe damage (Owen
  et al., 1992). This set of slides describes the executive deficits after frontal
  lobe lesions, and then compares them to the executive deficits seen in PD.'
